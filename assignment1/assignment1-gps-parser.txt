Your assignment is to parse the "$GPGGA" output of a GPS unit into a C++ struct that has the following fields:
     integer Time of fix (as seconds since the start of the day UTC)
     boolean validity
     floating point (double) Latitude  (as decimal degrees where West is negative, and East is positive)
     floating point (double) Longitude (as decimal degrees where North is positive, and South is negative)
     enumeration fix quality

See this website for definitions of the standard GPS messages: http://aprs.gids.nl/nmea/

The input file has other sentences that you should ignore.

After parsing the $GPGGA, display the output to the screen in a form like so:

"GPGGA { seconds_since_midnight: 53929 valid: true latitude: 41.314 longitude: -70.40 fix_quality: GPS_FIX }"
