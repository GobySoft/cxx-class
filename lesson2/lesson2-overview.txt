### Lesson parts

1. Parts of a class:
         constructor, destructor
         data
         member functions
         private, public, protected

2. Class inheritance:
         Triangle is a Shape
         Rectangle is a Shape
         Square is a Rectangle

3. Standard containers
         vector, list, set, multiset, deque
         map, unordered map, multimap, unordered multimap

4. Google Protocol Buffers - overview
         distinct language that compiles to native class representation
         "message" -> C++ class (or Python class, etc.)
         common "on-the-wire" format
         (extend CTD parser with GPB message)

         sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

5. DCCL
         Highly compact encoding for protocol buffers
         Additional meta-data - physical origin of data
         (extend CTD parser with DCCL message)
